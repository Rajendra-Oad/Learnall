AngularJS is a JavaScript-based open-source front-end web framework mainly maintained by Google and by a community of individuals and corporations. 

It's primarily used for building dynamic single-page web applications (SPAs).

AngularJS extends HTML attributes with Directives, and binds data to HTML with Expressions. It also handles dynamic views and data binding, allowing developers to build responsive web applications with less code.

One of the key features of AngularJS is its two-way data binding, which means that changes in the model (JavaScript variables) are automatically reflected in the view (HTML), and vice versa. This helps in synchronizing the model and the view without the need for boilerplate code.

AngularJS also provides dependency injection, which allows developers to write modular and testable code by injecting dependencies into components rather than hard-coding them.

However, it's worth noting that AngularJS (often referred to as Angular 1.x) has been succeeded by Angular (or Angular 2+), which is a complete rewrite of AngularJS. Angular introduces many new features and improvements over AngularJS, but both frameworks serve similar purposes in web development.
